First GitHub test project

Hi all!

I started to learn Python this spring. 
Before I have used PHP & MySQL, mostly in web & intranet projects.
And in from 1995 till 2003 I have used Visual Basic 3.0 Pro to create companys document and case management system KAIS.

Meanwhile I have used the SharePoint 2010, 2013 and now SharePoint 365 system.
